- **IDEs:** VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA

## Projects

### [Weather Application](https://github.com/banusriprakash/Myweather-App/tree/main)
<p>
    The Weather App is a Java-based application that provides users with real-time weather information for a specified location. It fetches weather data from an external API and displays it in a graphical user interface (GUI). Users can enter a location, and the app retrieves and 
    presents weather details, including temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed. This documentation outlines the project's architecture, technologies used, and the functionality of each class within the application.
</p>

### Fire alarm System
</p>
Build a reliable fire alarm system using basic components like a microcontroller, buzzer, thermistor, and gas sensor. Detecting smoke or high temperatures triggers the alarm, ensuring prompt response to potential fire hazards. Customizable thresholds and integration options make it adaptable for various environments.
